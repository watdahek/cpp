/*
std::shared_ptr : Shared Ownership

shared_ptr allows multiple smart pointers to own the same dynamically allocated object. 
Internally, it maintains a reference count. Each time a shared_ptr is copied, the count is incremented. 
When the last shared_ptr referencing the object is destroyed or reset, the object is automatically deallocated.

This makes shared_ptr ideal for cases where ownership is shared across different parts of the code 
â€” for example, when passing objects between layers or storing shared resources in containers. 
However, this flexibility comes at a cost. shared_ptr is heavier than unique_ptr because of the reference counting mechanism, 
and it may introduce circular reference issues in cases where two shared_ptrs are referencing each other, 
which can lead to memory leaks if not handled carefully.
